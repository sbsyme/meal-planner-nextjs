# Meal Planner üçΩÔ∏è
Creates a weekly meal plan, including a shopping list and recipes, using the OpenAI API based on the user's budget and preferred supermarket.

## Getting Started

1. Provide your OpenAI API Key in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
2. Create an assistant in the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
3. Provide the following system instructions:
```
Given a budget amount and a supermarket. You will provide a weekly meal plan that fits into that budget and consists of meals made up of items that can be found in that supermarket. 

Your response should first contain a shopping list of the items with their name as it appears wherever you fetched the information from, the quantity, the price and provide a reference link of where you found the pricing information. 

Then a meal plan breakdown for every day of the week where each day consists of 3 meals(breakfast, lunch and dinner) that can be cooked with the items in the shopping list. No meals should be repeated. 

Each meal should also have a detailed recipe with ingredients from the shopping list with their required quantities and a list of the individual steps required for the recipes preparation. These steps should be extensive and include details such as how high a heat to cook on, how finely to chop an ingredient, precise measurements of each ingredient, etc.
```
3. Feel free to change the model at your leisure but `gpt-4o` was used in development and provides the expected output.
4. Assign it with response format `json_schema` and paste the following schema:
